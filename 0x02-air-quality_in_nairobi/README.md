# Air quality in Nairobi

Data Source: https://africaopendata.org/dataset/sensorsafrica-airquality-archive-nairobi

This data set contains PM (particulate matter), temperature, and humidity readings taken with low-cost sensors. These sensors measure the concentration of PM in the air, including particles with diameters less than or equal to 1 micrometer (PM1), 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), and particles with diameters less than or equal to 10 micrometers (PM10). The data set includes information on the sensor type, date, time, and location of the readings, as well as the sensorâ€™s specific measurement values for Temperature (C), Humidity (%), PM1, PM2.5, and PM10.
