# Applied Data Science Portfolio

I successfully designed, developed, and delivered eight comprehensive data science projects. Each project involved four self-paced modules of study, culminating in a programmatically graded assessment, all of which I passed with a score of 90% or higher.

- Housing in Mexico
- Housing in Buenos Aires
- Air Quality in Nairobi
- Earthquake Damage in Nepal
- Bankruptcy in Poland
- Customer Segmentation in the US
- AB Testing
- Market Forecasting in India
